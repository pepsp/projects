1. I would probably calculate the average data of all the songs the user listened through the year. Energy, valence and danceability.
    SELECT AVG(danceability),AVG(energy),AVG(valence)
   ...> FROM songs;

2. I think you could also take in account the genres the user listened throught the year. What songs the listened the most,
and for how long he listened music each day
